notegui
===

You're working on a project and trying to take notes. 

Everytime you take notes, you have to switch applications. You lose context.

Use `notegui` instead. Open a note with a shortcut. Type in your note without losing your context, and then close it. 

`notegui` is lightweight. Notes get appended to a text file for you to review later.
